              The Karnak Temple Complex consists of a number of temples, chapels, and other buildings in the form of a village,
               <br>and is for that reason that the name Karnak was given to this complex as in Arabic Karnak means ‘fortified village’.
             <br>  During the New Kingdom, the Karnak Temple Complex was the center of the ancient faith while power was concentrated 
           <br>    at Thebes (modern-day Luxor) and its significance is reflected in its enormous size. 
           In addition to its religious significance,<br> it was also served as a treasury, administrative center, 
           and palace for the New Kingdom pharaohs. It is to this day considered <br>as the largest temple complex ever
            constructed anywhere in the world.</p>

               <p style="color: aliceblue;">● Karnak is an open-air museum. It is considered to be the largest religious building or site in the world.
         <br><br><br>● The 54,000 square feet Great Hypostyle Hall in the Karnak Temple is large enough to fit the Cathedral 
             of Notre Dame comfortably.<br><br>● Over eighty thousand servants and slaves were assigned the task of serving Amon-Ra in Karnak,
             <br> showing his power and importance at the time, also 5,000 statues were erected in his honor.

              The temple consists of three levels each of which has a colonnade at its far end. On the uppermost level,
               an open courtyard <br>lies just beyond the portico. Mummiform statues of Hatshepsut as Osiris, the god of the dead,
                lean against its pillars This<br> extraordinary beautiful Hatshepsut temple is also known as Djeser-Djeseru that was built for 
                the Eighteenth Dynasty<br> “Pharaoh Queen Hatshepsut“. It is one of the incomparable temples of ancient Egypt that is considered 
                to be the greatest<br> ancient Egyptian achievements. It is dedicated to Hatshepsut and Amun. The Egyptian monarch had the duties
                to honor <br>their gods and pharaohs and preserve their memory until eternity through the construction of tombs and temples.
                Queen <br>Hatshepsut was always aware of the ways to elevate her public image and immortalize her name, the Mortuary temple
                <br> achieved both ends. She was the daughter of a very powerful god in Egypt and that’s why she ruled as a man would. <br>
                 She ruled for about two decades.</p>

              <p style="color: aliceblue;" >  Hatshepsut (c.1473–1458 BC), the queen who became Pharaoh, built a magnificent temple at Deir al-Bahari,on the west<br> back of Luxor.
                 It lies directly across the Nile from Karnak Temple, the main sanctuary of the god Amun.
                 Hatshepsut’s temple,<br> Djeser-djeseru “the Holy of Holies” was designed by the chief steward of Amun, Senenmut.<br><br><br>

             At first glance, the Valley of the Kings, also known as the Valley of the Gates of the Kings, seems like no more than a sun-blasted<br>
              gorge of generic red rock, but underneath all of its dust lay the tombs of 63 of the most important pharaohs in the history of
               Ancient <br>Egypt. Used as a burial chamber for nearly 500 years from the 16th to 11th century BC, the Valley of the Kings was used
          for royal<br> burials for the Kings,  their families, and their possessions. In 1979, it became a World Heritage Site, as well as the rest of the Theban<br> Necropolis
          During the New Kingdom’s period of ancient Egyptian (1539-1075 B.C.), the Valley of the Kings was the major burial<br> ground for most of the royal pharaohs. 
          The most famous pharaohs buried there were Tutankhamun, Seti I, and Ramses II. Also, you<br> will find there the royal tombs of most of the 18th, 19th, and
           20th dynasties queens, high priests, and other elites of that era. Remember<br> that Tutankhamun was a relatively minor pharaoh, made famous by the fact that his 
           tomb is the only one in the valley that was discovered<br> with its contents still inside, not by the grandeur of his tomb relative to the others. Those contents 
           are now on display in the Egyptian <br>Museum in Cairo.</p>
          <h3 style="color: rgba(255, 51, 0, 0.767); font-size: 25px;"><b>Where is the Vally of the kings located?</b></h3>
          <p style="color: aliceblue;">The Valley of the Kings is located on the west bank of the Nile River near Luxor. It is the most famous site for having unique collections of <br>tombs and breathtaking 
          ancient ruins. That location makes it one of the hottest spots for exploring ancient Egyptian history.  The richness of<br> the findings here in the Valley of the Kings
           has kept archeologists busy for nearly two centuries. If all of the tombs here where open to visitors<br> it would be nearly impossible to actually make it to all of 
           them, but thankfully the possibility of such a huge task is eliminated for you.

              While it is not among the most well traveled sites on the West Bank, Medinat Habu is considered by many visitors to be among the most <br>impressive sights 
              they see in Luxor. This temple complex is impressively preserved, especially in comparison to the Ramesseum, on which<br> its plan is based.
             While the Ramesseum was built by a more famous pharaoh (Ramesses II), Medinat Habu, commissioned by Ramesses III,<br> is a much more impressive sight
              with its pylon and many of its walls still intact and much more of the original painting visible on its carved <br>surfaces.
             Ramesses III (reign 1184—1153 BC) was the last of the great pharaohs of Egypt. After his reign, Egypt began a long decline that led <br>to it being ruled by
              foreign powers for the majority of its history after the New Kingdom. After the empire stretched to its furthest extremes <br>under Ramesses II, the pressure 
              of invasion threats from multiple frontiers eventually proved too much.Ramesses III is the last pharaoh to whom<br> there are great building project attributed and 
              this temples complex was the biggest of them.     
             During his reign, Medinat Habu functioned as a walled <br>city with the temple and an administrative center inside of walls that protected the inhabitants of the area 
             during hard times. Later on, the complex<br> became a walled town for Coptic Christians living in the area.</p>

               The Luxor Temple was constructed of sandstone blocks from Nubia. The temple is surrounded by mud-brick walls which symbolize the separation <br>between the world 
                 and the sacred realm of the gods. The Temple’s design during the New Kingdom exhibited a set 
                 of common design features in the<br> construction of the temple. The Luxor Temple displays many of 
                 the features typical of temple construction known during the New Kingdom.</p>
