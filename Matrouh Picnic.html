       <h2>Queen Cleopatra had a palace there that overlooked her basins, known today as Cleopatra Beach. The sky is bright blue, the sand bright white, the sea perfect
        , and there's not a soul on the beach. Believed to be the bathing place of Cleopatra and Marcus Antonius; Cleopatra Beach sits about a 14km drive north-west of 
        Marsa Matrouh around the bay’s thin tentacle of land. The sea here is an exquisite turquoise hue, 
        and the rock formations are worth a look.</h2>

              the town of Marsa Matrouh.
               Set back in a small cove, the near white sands are trapped between cliffs on all sides. In fact, access to the beach is via a footpath down from 
               the clifftop, making it unsuitable 
               for very young children and those with movement issues. A small café at the top of the cliff offers refreshments. It is one of the few facilities
                beyond deck chairs and parasols. 
               It’s usually open between June and October, when the beach is at its busiest</h2>
