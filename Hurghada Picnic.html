                <h1>Hurghada Desert</h1>

                <p>Hurghada Desert is a part of Eastern desrt which streches along the Red Sea coast .There are many
                    activities to do in the desert like safari , camping watching the stars ,climbing the mountains or
                    visiting the villages of bedouine. With so much action happening in the water, some travellers
                    forget that back onshore there's an entire desert world to explore. Among Hurghada's most popular
                    on-the-ground things to do are quad biking, jeep expeditions, and dune buggy trips into the sand
                    dune hinterland. You don't have to travel very far off-road from the resort town to discover the
                    acacia tree-studded wadis (valleys), sandwiched in by red-tinged mountains, that make up most of the
                    landscape of the Eastern Desert.</p>
