                <h1>Hurghada</h1>
                <p>Different than many other destinations in Egypt like Luxor, Aswan, and Alexandria, where the ancient
                    Egyptians
                    resided and built their civilizations, Hurghada is rather a contemporary established city.

                    At the beginning of the 20th century, in the period from 1900 till 1920, Hurghada was a very small
                    village
                    for
                    the Arabian fishermen. Historical records claim that in 1906, there were only 6 primitive houses in
                    the
                    city.

                    The city has a simple commercial activity at the time as the fishermen used to dry the fish and then
                    sell it
                    to
                    the caravans coming from the Nile Valley. Moreover, in 1909, petrol was first discovered around
                    Hurghada.
                    However, the real excavation and production process began after the end of World War II.

                    Despite the fact that Hurghada is the largest city in the region of the Red Sea in Egypt today,
                    nothing more
                    was
                    known about Hurghada before the 1920s when sailors coming from the Arabian Peninsula came to fish
                    near the
                    Egyptian borders.

                    Their meeting point was a large tree which was called “Gharqad”, Nitraria in the Latin language.

                    There was a famous sentence that was common among these sailors; “let’s meet at the Ghardaqa”. This
                    was how
                    the
                    name Ghardaqa, or Hurghada in English mainly originated.</p>
